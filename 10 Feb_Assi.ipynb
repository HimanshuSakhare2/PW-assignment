For example: file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\").\\n\\n3. \"a\" (Append mode): In this mode, the file is opened for appending. If the file already exists, new data will be written to\\nthe end of the file. If it doesn\\'t exist, a new file will be created. For example: file = open(\"example.txt\", \"a\").\\n\\n4. \"x\" (Exclusive creation mode): In this mode, the file is opened for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. \\nIf the file exists, an error will occur. For example: file = open(\"example.txt\", \"x\").\\n\\n5. \"b\" (Binary mode): This mode is used to open binary files like images, videos, etc. For example: file = open(\"example.jpg\", \"rb\").\\n\\n6. \"t\" (Text mode): This mode is used to open text files in a readable format. This is the default mode when opening a file in Python. \\nFor example: file = open(\"example.txt\", \"rt\").\\n\\n7. \"+\" (Read and Write mode): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing.
